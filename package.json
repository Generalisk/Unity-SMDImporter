SMD's are the raw, uncompiled data files used in Valve's Source Engine that contains the 3-dimensional data of A mesh. SMD Importer allows you to directly drag and drop these files into Unity without having to import them into A 3D modelling software beforehand so you can convert them into A file format supported by Unity, which can be A tedious & time-consuming task depending on the model in question.",
